===============
* Precedence wrong with mixed mult and divide - need to fix order (perhaps additional passes?).

eg, 
    ((sin(x*20)+1)/2)*((sin(y*20)+1)/2)*((sin(z*20)+1)/2) 

...produces the expected result but :

    (sin(x*20)+1)/2*(sin(y*20)+1)/2*(sin(z*20)+1)/2

...does not. It is effectively resulting in :

    (sin(x*20)+1)/(2*(sin(y*20)+1)/(2*((sin(z*20)+1))))/2

...or something. Probably same issue exists with addition and subtraction.


^^^ Now fixed!
