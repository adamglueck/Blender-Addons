MathsExpression
===============
Creates a node tree from a types mathematical expression. This allows a complicated tree to be very easily constructed and is still fully GPU compatible (since it's only using 'standard' nodes).

ParticlesToPath
===============
Adds an option ('Particles to Nurbs') to the Add/Curve menu in the 3D View to convert a Particle System on the currently selected object into a (NURBS) curve. By emitting particles from a single vertex and then converting to a curve the path will follow the path of that vertex. This can be used to generate 'trails' as in this BSE answer : https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/94976/29586Download

Vertex Color Blend
==================
Adds a Blend Vertex Colors option to the Paint option in Vertex Paint mode. This uses a Vertex Group to set 'fixed' colors in the mesh and smears those colors over the mesh.
